# Copy-Move-Image-Tampering-Detection
Image can play major role as legal evidence in forensics and many other fields. Tampering of images means manipulation of images by using latest technologies which can create false evidence. This can be found using few deep learning algorithms.In this project I specifically mention copy move images which means copying the one portion in an image and pasting in the same image in different portion i.e.,place.
